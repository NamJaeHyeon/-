    <div style="display:none;" id="본문">Unprecedented Humid Heat Waves
Unprecedented levels of humid heat are being recorded.
It has gotten to the point that it is likely that some regions will become too hot for humans to inhabit in a few decades.
The effects of this comnination of extreme humidity and heat have already kicked off several environmental disasters decades earlier than the previously estimated timeline.
While the coronavirus pandemic has undoubtedly become the prime focus of the global community, increasing reports of natural disasters have made it clear that our environmental problem is still spriraling out of control.
The year 2019 in particular has experienced abnormally high temperatures and humidity that together precipitated massive wildfires and death tolls.
Before the enforcement of lockdowns and quarantines, populations in regions usch as Australia has been steadily shifting their internal clock to stay indoors during the day and operate during the night when it is cooler.
It is the high humidity that has made conditions so unbearable.
Normally, when it is hot, our bodies try to cool down by sweating.
As the sweat evaporates, it disperses the body’s heat to the air.
But the rate at which water or sweat dissipates into the air is determined by how much water is already present in the air.
Sweat evaporates faster on dry days than humid ones, which is why we feel like it is hotter on muggy days, where the air is saturated with water.
When the humidity of the air rises to a certain high level, our inbuilt cooling system becomes ineffectual and our bodies heat up.
And when the body temperature reaches an extreme level, even organs can shut down as the body starts cooking itself.
This is an exceedingly serious problem for populations living in the develoging world, where air conditioning is not widespread or easily accessible for the average household.
The futre looks bleak, as the regions predicted to be hit most severely by the humid heat waves over the next few decades consist mostly of poorer countries where people would have less resources to fight the escalating humid heat.
Vulnerable areas to the humid heat waves include parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South America, India, Southeast Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and Australia.
According to a recent study, if our planet’s temperature continues to rise at current levels over the next 50 years, approximately 3 billion people could end up living in areas too hot for humans.
Currentlu, extremely hot areas like the Sahara region cover 0.8 percent of the Earth’s landmass.
These areas are predicted to spread to 19 percent by 2070, resulting in a massive displacement of people that would be disastrous both economically and socially.
The clock is ticking, and the world needs to wake up and work together to slow down the warming of our planet.
Protests for Change
Many of us have never seen an uprising like this.
Every day, huge numbers of people have been coming out to protest in every single state in the U.S.
Since starting in Minnesota after the police killing of George Floyd, these protests for black lives have spread like nobody could have ever predicted.
And now, protests have started blowing up all over the world.
From Paris to Rome and Tokyo, people marched on the streets.
In Hungary, a silent crowd took a knee for eight minutes and 46 seconds.
In London, joining this protest mattered far more than the lockdown rules, so thousands gathered outside the American embassy.
These protests were sparked by the death of one man in one American city, but the anger and frustration expressed by the American people are familiar emotions that people can identify with, regardless of nationality.
Whether they are part of the minority in terms of race, gender, religion, financial status, or disability, the underlying issue of discrimination is something that every person has experienced at least one point in their lives.
This is why we now have people in every country standing together to say that this is not acceptable anymore.
Just after two weeks of theses global protests, we are already seeing credible results, both large and small.
For instance, there has long been a contention in the U.S. about the Confederate monuments and other racist statues that are littered around the countery.
Despite decades of people asking the government to take them down, all they had been met with were platitudes and empty promises.
Now, however, we are finally seeing theses statues being taken down, and it’s not just in the U.S.
In the U.K., the Black Lives Matter movement has pressed the country to confront its colonial past.
Protesters Have taken down and tossed into the sea a statue of a slave trader.
They are fighting for statues of colonialists, slave owners, and known racists to be removed.
Immense social pressure is on both governments and corporations to act on racial inequality.
Companies and political parties are scrambling to offer their sympathies and promise changes.
L’Oreal is one such company.
It has asked for model Munroe Bergdorf to return to advise the company of diversity and inclusion three years after it dropped her for comments about systemic racism.
The world has been moved by the situation in the U.S. and has responded in various ways.
Only time will tell if theses changes and promises will be held true in the years to come.</div>
