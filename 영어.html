Many of us have never seen an uprising like this.
Every day, huge numbers of people have been coming out to protest in every single state in the U.S.
Since starting in Minnesota after the police killing of George Floyd, these protests for black lives have spread like nobody could have ever predicted.
And now, protests have started blowing up all over the world.
From Paris to Rome and Tokyo, people marched on the streets.
In Hungary, a silent crowd took a knee for eight minutes and 46 seconds.
In London, joining this protest mattered far more than the lockdown rules, so thousands gathered outside the American embassy.
These protests were sparked by the death of one man in one American city, but the anger and frustration expressed by the American people are familiar emotions that people can identify with, regardless of nationality.
Whether they are part of the minority in terms of race, gender, religion, financial status, or disability, the underlying issue of discrimination is something that every person has experienced at least one point in their lives.
This is why we now have people in every country standing together to say that this is not acceptable anymore.
Just after two weeks of theses global protests, we are already seeing credible results, both large and small.
For instance, there has long been a contention in the U.S. about the Confederate monuments and other racist statues that are littered around the countery.
Despite decades of people asking the government to take them down, all they had been met with were platitudes and empty promises.
Now, however, we are finally seeing theses statues being taken down, and it’s not just in the U.S.
In the U.K., the Black Lives Matter movement has pressed the country to confront its colonial past.
Protesters Have taken down and tossed into the sea a statue of a slave trader.
They are fighting for statues of colonialists, slave owners, and known racists to be removed.
Immense social pressure is on both governments and corporations to act on racial inequality.
Companies and political parties are scrambling to offer their sympathies and promise changes.
L’Oreal is one such company.
It has asked for model Munroe Bergdorf to return to advise the company of diversity and inclusion three years after it dropped her for comments about systemic racism.
The world has been moved by the situation in the U.S. and has responded in various ways.
Only time will tell if theses changes and promises will be held true in the years to come.</div>
